# Blood-Bank-Database-Management-System-Project
**Problem**:
Problems arise when hospitals are required to retrieve the necessary data to match the blood type of recipients requiring a transfusion in a timely manner. 

**Goal**:
The mission is to provide an easy-to-use/accessible platform to donors and hospitals. The team aims to deliver a secure way to access donor history and timely updates regarding bloodstock available at the hospital by which they are always informed, where they can quickly check/have access to stock level. 

The project plan includes the 10 Knowledge Areas of PM, which cater to the end user’s specific requirements and the stakeholders. Depending on the end-user, the application will narrow down the user interface to provide accurate and timely details about blood reserves that would potentially save someone’s life.
